This code is a machine learning model for classifying emails as spam or ham using the Naive Bayes algorithm. It includes the following steps:

- Imports the necessary libraries for data processing, modeling, and evaluation.
Loads the email data from a CSV file into a pandas DataFrame.
- Preprocesses the data by converting the categorical label column to numerical (0 for spam and 1 for ham), and splitting the data into input (X) and target (y) variables.
- Instantiates the preprocessor objects - a TfidfVectorizer for converting text data to numerical vectors, and a MultinomialNB classifier for classification.
- Creates a pipeline that combines the preprocessor and classifier objects.
- Split the data into training and testing sets.
- Trains the model on the training set using the fit() method.
- Evaluates the model's performance on the training and testing sets using accuracy_score and classification_report.

To use this code on your own data, replace the file name with the name of your own CSV file. Also, make sure that the CSV file has a "Category" column with values "spam" or "ham", and a "Message" column with the email text.

This code is provided as an example and can be modified to fit your specific needs. Good luck with your machine learning project!
