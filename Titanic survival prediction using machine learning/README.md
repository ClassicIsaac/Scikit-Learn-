This code is an implementation of a machine learning model to predict survival of passengers aboard the Titanic based on a number of features such as age, sex, ticket class, etc. The code is written in Python and uses various libraries such as pandas and scikit-learn.

INSTALLATION
To run the code, you will need to install Python 3.x and the following libraries:
pandas
scikit-learn
You can install the libraries using pip, by running the following command:
pip install pandas scikit-learn
After installing the required libraries, you can download the code from the GitHub repository.

USAGE
The code can be run in a Jupyter notebook or as a standalone Python script. To run the code, you can simply execute the script. The output will be the best model and its hyperparameters, along with the accuracy score.

DATA
The dataset used in this project is the Titanic dataset, which contains information about passengers on the Titanic, including whether they survived or not. The dataset can be downloaded from Kaggle.
