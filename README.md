This repository contains several projects that demonstrate the use of the Scikit-Learn library for building machine learning models to make predictions. The projects cover a range of topics and use different datasets to showcase various techniques for data cleaning, feature engineering, model selection, and evaluation.

## USAGE
To use a project, navigate to its folder in the repository and follow the instructions provided in the README file. Typically, you will need to run a Python script that loads the dataset, preprocesses the data, trains the machine learning model, and evaluates its performance on a test set.
